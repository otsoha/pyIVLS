# Style guide
Formatting enforced with [Ruff Formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) with standard settings (Except for max_line_length of 120). New code should strive to use the naming convention defined in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). Package requirements are handled with [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
