# measurement of 10C
#
#date 07-Apr-2025 16:31:07
#Keithley source smua
#Source in voltage injection mode
#Steps in sweep 100 
#Sweep repeat for 1 times 
#Start value for sweep 0 V
#End value for sweep 2.2 V
#Limit for sweep step 0.05 A
#Measurement acquisition period is done in AUTO mode
#NPLC value 20 ms (for detected line frequency 50 Hz is 1.000)
#
#
#Continuous operation of the source
#
#
#
#
#Back voltage to PD 0.100 V
#
#
#Comment: 
#
#
#
#
#
#High capacitance mode is disabled (normal operation)
#
